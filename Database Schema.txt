Database Schema:

Collection :
 
user{
   name: String,
   Password:String,
   Email: String
}

Discription:
This is the collection that i have imparted in the application for displaying the user credentials on the home screen after the login.

Authentication:
     I have used the Firebase Authentication to login, sign-in, and forgot-password functionalities.I have used email/password  provider authentication which is an internally modified version of scrypt to hash account passwords. Even when an account is uploaded with a password using a different algorithm, Firebase Auth will rehash the password the first time that account successfully logs in.
